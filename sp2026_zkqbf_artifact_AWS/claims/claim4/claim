Claim: A practical ZK Protocol for verifying True QBFs through the validation of 
       private Skolem Functions.

How to read result.txt:
The last 4 lines in the file should look something like -
a 316.143 r 95.0711 i 33.2082 t 444.423
skolem function checking time: 15.1427
communication:1540255698
----end----

This means that the 
- Access time-cost ("a") is ~316.1 seconds
- Time-cost for Boolean Resolution ("r") is ~95.0 seconds
- Time-cost for input ("i") is ~33.2
- Time-cost for Checking the derivation of private portion of the input formula from a valid skolem function ("skolem function checking time") is ~15.1 seconds
- Total time for the protocol is ("t") is ~444.4 seconds

The communication cost for the protocol is ~1540255698 bytes (second to last line)
