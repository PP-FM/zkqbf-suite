Claim: A practical ZK Protocol for verifying False QBFs through the validation of 
       private Herbrand Functions.

How to read result.txt:
The last 4 lines in the file should look something like -
a 332.825 r 70.1292 i 20.2054 t 426.568
herbrand function checking time 3.26262
communication:2664239762
----end----

This means that the 
- Access time-cost ("a") is ~332.8 seconds
- Time-cost for Boolean Resolution ("r") is ~70.1 seconds
- Time-cost for input ("i") is ~20.2
- Time-cost for Checking the derivation of private portion of the input formula from a valid herbrand function ("herbrand function checking time") is ~3.2 seconds
- Total time for the protocol is ("t") is ~426.5 seconds

The communication cost for the protocol is ~2664239762 bytes (second to last line)
