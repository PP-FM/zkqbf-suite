Trends for ZKWS-Herbrand: We claim that zkws-herbrand efficiently verifies Herbrand functions (Winning strategies for False QBFs) in zero-knowledge.
Selected benchmark instances demonstrate successful verification of Herbrand functions with very efficient proving time, with communication cost scaling linearly in clause count Ã— width. Evaluators can reproduce these results to observe the clear trend of efficiency, and we provided plotting script to reproduce Figure 13 in paper.
