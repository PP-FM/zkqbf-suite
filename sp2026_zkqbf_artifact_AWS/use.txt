This package present the following 4 interactive ZK protocols:

1)  ZKQRES
2)  ZKWS-Herbrand
3)  ZKWS-Skolem
4)  ZKQCUBE

These protocols are intended to prove the truth value of QBFs while keeping their proofs private. 


The artifact is not suitable for:

Running on low-resource environments (e.g., low RAM (< 64GB) laptops or small VMs), since verification requires very large RAM and storage.
General-purpose ZK applications outside PSPACE/QBF, as the implementation is tailored specifically to QBF encodings and associated certificates.
Deployment in latency-sensitive or production cryptographic settings, as the focus is on research evaluation rather than optimized deployment.
