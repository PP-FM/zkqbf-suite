Our artifact requires only a single machine with ~64 GB RAM to verify QBF instances (prover and verifier can be co-located, communicating over localhost). Although public research infrastructures are encouraged, in practice they rarely provide such configurations on demand; and even when they do, job schedulers, wall-time limits, and long install times make them impractical to work with at this stage. Moreover, we found these public infrastructures hard to access due to the logistics of creating projects (as an international student) and obtaining approvals. We have successfully tested our artifact on AWS EC2 (64 GB RAM), and our scaled-down benchmarks finish within 4 hours and need only <30 GB of local storage. Therefore, using AWS is the only practical way for us to ensure smooth, reproducible evaluation without infrastructure delays.
