Our artifact requires a single machine with ~64 GB RAM to verify QBF instances (prover and verifier co-located, communicating over localhost). Although public research infrastructures are encouraged, in practice they rarely provide such configurations on demand; and even when they do, job schedulers, wall-time limits, and long install times make them impractical within the AE window. Moreover, we found these public infrastructures hard to access due to the logistics of creating projects and obtaining approvals. We have successfully tested on AWS EC2 (64 GB RAM), and our scaled-down benchmarks finish within 4 hours and need only ~30 GB of local storage. Using AWS is therefore a practical way to ensure smooth, reproducible evaluation without infrastructure delays.
