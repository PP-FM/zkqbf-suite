Our evaluation requires resources beyond public research infrastructures. In particular, verifying large QBF instances need hundreds of GB of RAM and ~1TB storage for proof traces and intermediate files. Please refer to the "Testbed" information on Section 6.1 of the paper. To run the protocol for QBFs with a meaningful proof size, we would need at least 64GB RAM. To the best of our knowledge, this exceeds "free-tier" public infrastructure limits. Moreover, our protocols are interactive and communication-intensive, requiring high-bandwidth links to avoid network noise. So, the protocol on a single 64GB RAM machine would mean the combined RAM usage of both prover and verifier can only be 64GB. While not ideal, this is sufficient for our smaller benchmarks. Moreover, public testbeds often restrict job wall-times or disallow long-running interactive tasks, which might cause failure in testing and evaluation. These constraints requires us to use a private, "non-free-tier" research infrastructure like AWS EC2.
